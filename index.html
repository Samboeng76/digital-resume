 <h1> Sam English's Digital Resume </h2>
    <p>I'm a senior in Computer Engineering at MSU</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm experienced in C and C++</p>
    <p>I'm experienced in working with microcontrollers</p>
    <p>I have IT experience</p>
    <br>
    <p>Over the summer, I worked at Farmer's and Merchant's Bank doing IT. My job was
    to keep all of the computers up to date and to replace any eqipment that was broken.
    Farmer's and Merchant's was where I worked during my senior year of highschool and while
    at Northeast Mississippi Community College.</p>

    <p>Note: I didn't know if it was supposed to be a picture of ourselves.
    If so, I didn't really have a good one, so enjoy this really laggy gif
    of Dante dancing. I'll add my own picture later if I need to. </p>
